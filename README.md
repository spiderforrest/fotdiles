## spider's config files

Hi there! Here are my dotfiles, not much to say here. Software:

- [Bedrock Linux](https://bedrocklinux.org)-A meta distribution that manages assembling a system of parts from multiple distributions. Below are the actual distributions I use as strata, roughly ordered by usage.
    - [void-musl/void](https://voidlinux.org)-I prefer void [musl](https://musl.libc.org) for most system components, but with the glibc dependence of some applications I must use, I fall back to fetching packages from void-glibc, then archlinux, and so on.
    - [Arch](https://archlinux.org)
    - [Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org)
    - [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org)
    - [Gentoo](https://gentoo.org)
    - [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io)-hey emacs users can we call the war off and go beat up vscode please
