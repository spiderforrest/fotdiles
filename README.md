## spider's config files

Hi there! Here are my dotfiles, not much to say here. Software:

- [Bedrock Linux](https://bedrocklinux.org)-A meta distribution that manages assembling a system of parts from multiple distributions. Below are the actual distributions I use as strata, roughly ordered by usage.
    - [void-musl/void](https://voidlinux.org)-I prefer void [musl](https://musl.libc.org) for most system components, but with the glibc dependence of some applications I must use, I fall back to fetching packages from void-glibc, then archlinux, and so on.
    - [Arch](https://archlinux.org)
    - [Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org)
    - [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org)
    - [Gentoo](https://gentoo.org)
    - [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io)-hey emacs users can we call the war off and go beat up vscode please
- [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org)-Awesome is a framework, not a setup application, and my configs are expansive
- [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org)-term
- [Qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org)-modal browser
- [Chore](https://github.com/paradigm/chore)-cli todo list by the guy who did bedrock. Good shit.
- [Redshift](https://github.com/jonls/redshift)-my eyes. Sometime when I'm less broke I'll get an e-ink monitor.
- [Ly](https://github.com/fairyglade/ly)-display manager
- [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org)-screenshots
- [Picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom)-honestly I'm currently just using this for transparent borders
- [Xfce4 Mime Settings](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-settings/4.14/mime)-big thanks to xfce for having so many useful modular components.
- [Quantum Mechanical Keyboards](https://github.com/spiderforrest/qmk_firmware)-honorable mention. My fork of QMK, I use the [Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58)
