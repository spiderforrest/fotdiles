star G430s
4x3 in

width is 1 inch, so 4/1

hight is that by 16/9 aspect, which is 1.7777... and that's 0.5625 inches, give or take an infinite number of zeros before a 1

so 3/0.5625 is 5.3333...

no offset is fine


so

xinput set-prop "XP-PEN G430S Pen" "Coordinate Transformation Matrix" 4 0 0 0 5.333 0 0 0 1


well that didn't work

xinput-gui, should i be ashamed
